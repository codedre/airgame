Airgame is a free, open-source, super simple website platform for political campaigns. It installs like any other WordPress theme, but comes preloaded with tons of powerful baked-in features designed around the specific use case of online political fundraising, communication, and organizing. And it's wrapped in cutting-edge design and beautiful open-source fonts and assets.
